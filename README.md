# 💥 Crystalline Giant Boss Tracker

## ✨ What is this?

This is a **solo Magic: The Gathering (MTG) mini-game** designed so you can play your paper Commander deck against a powerful "boss" — the **Crystalline Giant**, powered by its own custom 25-card side deck.

---

## 💎 How does it work?

- You play your normal Commander deck as usual.
- The Giant starts with 40 life, and on each boss turn:
  - Gains a random keyword counter (e.g., Flying, Lifelink, Hexproof).
  - Plays a random card from its side deck (auras, wipes, tokens, or disruption).
  - Automatically creates and groups tokens by power/toughness.
- You can manually adjust power/toughness, life, and tokens if your cards interact (e.g., if you shrink the Giant or destroy tokens).
- The Giant can "die" and respawn, keeping its auras and buffs as appropriate.

## 💎 Visual representation

The Giant is represented by a large 💎 emoji title instead of an image.  
You can toggle the **Oracle text** (rules text) below the emoji to remind yourself how the Giant’s counter mechanic works.
